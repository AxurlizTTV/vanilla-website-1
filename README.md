Still learning to get comfortable with html and css, so outside of work practice, i will fiddle around (as i did here) to get comfortable with the editor enviroments, and code structure.

This code is followed from this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7WbVj5apxU).
Thank you **Dev Ed** for this amazing tutorial. (links to his socials at the bottom)
I know what the html and css does, so it was not to learn what different elements do. Followed this to mostly learn about structure and having the code clean.
This can be seen in areas like:
```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  background: linear-gradient(to left top, 
              rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8), 
              rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)
  );
  border-radius: 1vh;
  margin: 2vh 0;
  padding: 2vh;
  box-shadow: 6px 6px 20px rgba(122, 122, 122, 0.2);
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```
Where i line up code that belongs together, for easier readability.
And it can be seen here:
```css
.progress1,
.progress2,
.progress3 {
  background: linear-gradient(to right top, #65dfc9, #6cdbeb);
  width: 100%;
  height: 25%;
  border-radius: 1vh;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
Where i instead of having it like this:
```css
.progress1, .progress2, .progress3 {

}
```
I make it be sorted below eachother.
Next vanilla project i will do i will keep these tricks in mind.
